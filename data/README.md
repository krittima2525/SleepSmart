# Dataset Documentation for Disorder Detection Classification Project

## Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [insert source here, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, etc.]. It contains information related to sleep health and lifestyle factors that may contribute to various sleep disorders.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- **Column 1**: Description of the first column.
- **Column 2**: Description of the second column.
- **Column 3**: Description of the third column.
- **...**: Additional columns as necessary.

## Preprocessing Steps
Before using the dataset for model training, the following preprocessing steps are recommended:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and remove duplicates.
2. **Normalization**: Scale numerical features to a standard range.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Create new features that may enhance model performance.
4. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

## Usage
To load and preprocess the dataset, use the functions provided in `src/data_preprocessing.py`. Ensure that all preprocessing steps are completed before proceeding to model training.
